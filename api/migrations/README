Alembic migrations live here.

- To create a new migration: `flask db migrate -m "message"` (with `FLASK_APP=app.main` set).
- To apply migrations locally: `flask db upgrade`.
- The production cluster runs against a managed MySQL instance; schema changes should ship via migrations to keep environments in sync.
